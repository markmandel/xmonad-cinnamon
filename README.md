Allows you to use xmonad wm with Cinnamon Session infrastructure. This is completely based on [i3-cinnamon](https://github.com/jbbr/i3-cinnamon)

# What to expect from this?
With `xmonad-cinnamon` you get along with xmonad (Window Manager) and GNOME (Desktop Environment) instead of metacity (the default window manager of GNOME).
See [more](https://github.com/lvillani/i3-gnome/issues/10).
